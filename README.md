From The NASA planetary Data I found out that

TrES-2 b Was the most frequent detected planet across all the facilities. It was reported the highest amount, 33 Times in the dataset.

Here We can see the most complex systems , sy_snum = number of stars in that system.

In those complex systems i visualized the number of planets. We can see here that HD 110067 System is one of the most complex systems out there with 3 stars and 6 planets.

The most common method for discovering exoplanets is the transit method. This involves observing a star and detecting periodic dips in its brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it, blocking some of the star's light.

This is the log10 of the count values visualized.
